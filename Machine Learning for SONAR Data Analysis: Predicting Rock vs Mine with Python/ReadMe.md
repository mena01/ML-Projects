# SONAR Data Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify SONAR signals as either rock or mine. The dataset comprises labeled columns representing SONAR signal measurements and the target classification.

## Dataset
- **Rows**: 208
- **Columns**: 60 features + 1 label column
- **Label**: Binary classification:
  - `R`: Rock
  - `M`: Mine

## Features
The dataset consists of 60 numerical features representing SONAR signal readings. Each row is labeled as either a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`).

## Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Libraries Used**:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
